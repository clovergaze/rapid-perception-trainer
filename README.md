# Rapid Perception Trainer
The goal of this program is to help train the eye-brain connection to rapidly recognize text.

The inspiration for this program comes from a Flash application that I used almost a decade ago, that had a similar concept.
The words are mostly [basic English words](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_basic_words) as they appear on the Wikionary.
